Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Expander.

2.4 Fri Nov 18 02:37:29 EET 2005

    - removed 'STYLE' notion, keyword replaced with MODE to avoid
      HTML's 'STYLE' tag. I admit it was awful if you use inline
      styles :) sorry.
   - %ENV is not used by default enymore. if you want old behaviour
     merge %ENV inside Expander's internal environment.   

2.3 Wed Sep 22 13:11:16 EEST 2004

    - fixed recursion stop logic
    - removed debug prints

2.2 Wed Sep 22 00:15:06 EEST 2004

    - fixed (%VAR) interpolation before %arg tag interpolation
